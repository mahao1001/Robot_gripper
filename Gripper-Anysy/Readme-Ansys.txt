Parallelogram mechanism design

1. The load is 50N, the superimposed torque M = F*x when moving to the end position of the clamping tool. Calculated based on the tool being 100mm, when clamping to the position of 50, the torque M = 50*50 NÂ·mm
2. Optimization goals: total mass, maximum deformation, maximum stress

Initial value: L1:=35 A1=83 R2=5
Initial total mass: 0.16283kg, deformation 0.63961mm, stress 126.99MPa
Initial variables: connecting rod length L1, offset angle A1, connecting rod width R2
Optimization goal: minimum mass, minimum deformation/stress

Optimal solution: L1:=31.535 A1=74.783 R2=5.0026
Optimal values: deformation 0.63858 stress 84.927 mass 0.16043
