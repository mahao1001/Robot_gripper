Improved Black-winged Kite Algorithm and Finite Element Analysis for Robot Parallel Gripper Design

The supporting materials of the paper include the source code and models used in the research:

The file "Robot gripper-MATLAB" contains the improved BKA, and the optimal solution of the robot gripper is obtained through calculation and solution;

The document "Gripper-Anysy" performs a finite element analysis of the parallelogram mechanism of the machine factory gripper, and the experimental design results are obtained;

The file "BKA-BPNN" establishes a neural network model to predict different results obtained by different design solutions. This is a regression prediction;

The file "Gripper-ADAMS" is a virtual prototype and motion simulation of the optimal design results;

The file "Gripper 3D model" uses SolidWorks software for 3D modeling to facilitate 3D printing and production of physical objects;

The file "Gripper 3D printing" is the physical prototype produced.
